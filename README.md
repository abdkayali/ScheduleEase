**ScheduleEase** is a solution, using the power of .NET and Microsoft Graph, for our university students to add their timetable easily to their calendars.

In fact, every week, our university pins a printed version of our timetables in the notice board. We thought of making students' lives easier by creating ScheduleEase. **ScheduleEase** helps students remember their sessions and not miss anything interesting, and avoid the burden to add the sessions manually. 

You can find some examples of our timetables in /images so you can test the application.
